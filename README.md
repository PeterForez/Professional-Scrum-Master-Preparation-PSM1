# Purpose of the Scrum Guide
We developed Scrum in the early 1990s. We wrote the first version of the Scrum Guide in 2010 to help people worldwide understand Scrum. We have evolved the Guide since then through small, functional updates. Together, we stand behind it.  
The Scrum Guide contains the `definition of Scrum`. Each element of the framework serves a specific purpose that is essential to the overall value and results realized with Scrum. Changing the core design or ideas of Scrum, leaving out elements, or not following the rules of Scrum, covers up problems and limits the benefits of Scrum, potentially even rendering it useless.  
We follow the growing use of Scrum within an ever-growing complex world. We are humbled to see Scrum being adopted in many domains holding essentially complex work, beyond software product development where Scrum has its roots. As Scrum’s use spreads, developers, researchers, analysts, scientists, and other specialists do the work. We use the word `“developers”` in Scrum not to exclude, but to simplify. If you get value from Scrum, consider yourself included.  
As Scrum is being used, patterns, processes, and insights that fit the Scrum framework as described in this document, may be found, applied and devised. Their description is beyond the purpose of the Scrum Guide because they are context sensitive and differ widely between Scrum uses. Such tactics for using within the Scrum framework vary widely and are described elsewhere.

Explanation  
Scrum was initially developed for managing and developing products. Starting in the early 1990s, Scrum has been used extensively, worldwide, to:
1. Research and identify viable markets, technologies, and product capabilities;
2. Develop products and enhancements;
3. Release products and enhancements, as frequently as many times per day;
4. Develop and sustain Cloud (online, secure, on-demand) and other operational environments for product use; and,
5. Sustain and renew products.
Scrum has been used to develop software, hardware, embedded software, networks of interacting function, autonomous vehicles, schools, government, marketing, managing the operation of organizations and almost everything we use in our daily lives, as individuals and societies.

# Scrum Definition
Scrum is a lightweight `framework` that helps people, teams and organizations generate value through adaptive solutions for complex problems.
In a nutshell, Scrum requires a Scrum Master to foster an environment where:
1. A Product Owner orders the work for a complex problem into a Product Backlog.
2. The Scrum Team turns a selection of the work into an Increment of value during a Sprint.
3. The Scrum Team and its stakeholders inspect the results and adjust for the next Sprint.
4. Repeat

Scrum is simple. Try it as is and determine if its philosophy, theory, and structure help to achieve goals and create value. The Scrum framework is purposefully `incomplete`, only defining the parts required to implement Scrum theory. Scrum is built upon by the collective intelligence of the people using it. Rather than provide people with detailed instructions, the rules of Scrum guide their relationships and interactions.

Various processes, techniques and methods can be employed within the framework. Scrum wraps around existing practices or renders them unnecessary. Scrum makes visible the relative efficacy of current management, environment, and work techniques, so that improvements can be made.

# Scrum Theory
Scrum is founded on `empiricism and lean thinking`. **Empiricism** asserts that knowledge comes from experience and making decisions based on what is observed. **Lean thinking** reduces waste and focuses on the essentials.

Scrum employs an iterative, incremental approach to optimize predictability and to control risk. Scrum engages groups of people who collectively have all the skills and expertise to do the work and share or acquire such skills as needed.

Scrum combines `four formal events` for inspection and adaptation within a containing event, the Sprint. These events work because they implement the empirical Scrum pillars of transparency, inspection, and adaptation.

(choose the best answer)
- [ ] Planning, Demonstration, Retrospective. 
- [ ] Planning, Inspection, Adaptation. 
- [x] Inspection, Transparency, Adaptation.

___
#### Question:  
Which two of the following are pillars of Scrum?
(Select the best two answers)
- [ ] Value optimization
- [x] Adaptation
- [ ] Creativity
- [ ] Sustainable pace
- [x] Transparency
</details>

## Transparency 
The emergent process and work must be visible to those performing the work as well as those receiving the work. With Scrum, important decisions are based on the perceived state of its three formal artifacts. Artifacts that have low transparency can lead to decisions that diminish value and increase risk.

Transparency enables inspection. Inspection without transparency is misleading and wasteful.
<details><summary>Questions</summary>

#### Question:  
Which of the following best describes transparency?
- [ ] The process should be visible and understood by stakeholders and project managers.
- [x] Significant aspects of the process must be visible to those responsible for the outcome.
- [ ] Significant aspects of the process must be visible to stakeholders and project managers.
- [ ] The whole process should be visible to everyone.
</details>

## Inspection
The Scrum artifacts and the progress toward agreed goals must be `inspected frequently` and diligently to detect potentially undesirable variances or problems. To help with inspection, Scrum provides cadence in the form of its five events.

Inspection enables adaptation. Inspection without adaptation is considered pointless. Scrum events are designed to provoke change.
<details><summary>Questions</summary>

#### Question:  
How regularly should Scrum users examine Scrum artifacts and progress approaching a Sprint Goal?
(choose the best answer)
- [x] Frequently, but it should not get in the way of the work
- [ ] After the Daily Scrum
- [ ] As frequently as possible
- [ ] At the Sprint Review
</details>

## Adaptation
If any aspects of a process deviate outside acceptable limits or if the resulting product is unacceptable, the process being applied or the materials being produced must be adjusted. The adjustment must be made as soon as possible to minimize further deviation.

Adaptation becomes more difficult when the people involved are not empowered or self-managing. A Scrum Team is expected to adapt the moment it learns anything new through inspection.

# Scrum Values
Successful use of Scrum depends on people becoming more proficient in living five values:

<center>Commitment, Focus, Openness, Respect, and Courage</center>

1. The Scrum Team **commits** to achieving its goals and to supporting each other. 
2. Their primary **focus** is on the work of the Sprint to make the best possible progress toward these goals. 
3. The Scrum Team and its stakeholders are **open** about the work and the challenges. 
4. Scrum Team members **respect** each other to be capable, independent people, and are respected as such by the people with whom they work. 
5. The Scrum Team members have the **courage** to do the right thing, to work on tough problems.

These values give direction to the Scrum Team with regard to their work, actions, and behavior. The decisions that are made, the steps taken, and the way Scrum is used should reinforce these values, not diminish or undermine them. The Scrum Team members learn and explore the values as they work with the Scrum events and artifacts. When these values are embodied by the Scrum Team and the people they work with, the empirical Scrum pillars of transparency, inspection, and adaptation come to life building trust.

</details>

# Scrum Team
The `fundamental unit` of Scrum is a small team of people, a Scrum Team. The Scrum Team consists of one Scrum Master, one Product Owner, and Developers. Within a Scrum Team, there are `no sub-teams or hierarchies`. It is a cohesive unit of professionals focused on one objective at a time, the Product Goal.

Scrum Teams are `cross-functional`, meaning the members have all the skills necessary to create value each Sprint. They are also `self-managing`, meaning they internally decide who does what, when, and how.

The Scrum Team is small enough to remain nimble and large enough to complete significant work within a Sprint, typically `10 or fewer people`. In general, we have found that smaller teams communicate better and are more productive. If Scrum Teams become too large, they should consider reorganizing into multiple cohesive Scrum Teams, each focused on the same product. Therefore, they should share the same Product Goal, Product Backlog, and Product Owner.

The Scrum Team is responsible for all product-related activities from stakeholder collaboration, verification, maintenance, operation, experimentation, research and development, and anything else that might be required. They are structured and `empowered by the organization` to manage their own work. Working in Sprints at a sustainable pace improves the Scrum Team’s focus and consistency.

The entire Scrum Team is accountable for creating a `valuable, useful Increment every Sprint`. Scrum defines three specific accountabilities within the Scrum Team: the Developers, the Product Owner, and the Scrum Master.

## Developers
Developers are the people in the Scrum Team that are `committed to creating any aspect of a usable Increment` each Sprint.

The specific skills needed by the Developers are often `broad` and will vary with the domain of work. However, the Developers are always accountable for:
- `Creating a plan for the Sprint`, the Sprint Backlog;
- `Instilling quality` by adhering to a Definition of Done;
- `Adapting` their plan each day toward the Sprint Goal; and,
- `Holding each other` accountable as professionals.

- [ ] True

Explanation  
Scrum does not prohibit the Product Owner or the Scrum Master do development work. However, it is not the best practice because it could create a conflict of interest.
</details>

## Product Owner
The Product Owner is accountable for `maximizing the value` of the product resulting from the work of the Scrum Team. How this is done may vary widely across organizations, Scrum Teams, and individuals.

The Product Owner is also accountable for effective `Product Backlog management`, which includes:
- Developing and explicitly communicating the Product Goal;
- Creating and clearly communicating Product Backlog items;
- Ordering Product Backlog items; and,
- Ensuring that the Product Backlog is transparent, visible and understood.

The Product Owner may do the above work or may delegate the responsibility to others. Regardless, the Product Owner remains accountable.

For Product Owners to succeed, the entire organization must respect their decisions. These decisions are visible in the content and ordering of the Product Backlog, and through the inspectable Increment at the Sprint Review.

The Product Owner is one person, not a committee. The Product Owner may represent the needs of many stakeholders in the Product Backlog. Those wanting to change the Product Backlog can do so by trying to convince the Product Owner.

#### Question:  
At some point during the product development cycle, a key stakeholder started using the product and was unhappy with its quality. Thus, he made his concern very clear to the Product Owner. According to the key stakeholder, the product’s performance was below what he expected. Thus, the Product Owner went to talk to you, the Scrum Master, about this issue. What should you tell her?

# Scrum Events
The Sprint is a container for all other events. Each event in Scrum is a formal opportunity to inspect and adapt Scrum artifacts. These events are specifically designed to enable the transparency required. Failure to operate any events as prescribed results in lost opportunities to inspect and adapt. Events are used in Scrum to create regularity and to minimize the need for meetings not defined in Scrum.
Optimally, all events are held at the same time and place to reduce complexity.

</details>

## The Sprint
Sprints are the heartbeat of Scrum, where ideas are turned into value.

They are fixed length events of one month or less to create consistency. A new Sprint starts immediately after the conclusion of the previous Sprint.

All the work necessary to achieve the Product Goal, including Sprint Planning, Daily Scrums, Sprint Review, and Sprint Retrospective, happen within Sprints.

During the Sprint:
- No changes are made that would endanger the Sprint Goal;
- Quality does not decrease;
- The Product Backlog is refined as needed; and,
- Scope may be clarified and renegotiated with the Product Owner as more is learned.

Sprints enable predictability by ensuring inspection and adaptation of progress toward a Product Goal at least every calendar month. When a Sprint’s horizon is too long the Sprint Goal may become invalid, complexity may rise, and risk may increase. Shorter Sprints can be employed to generate more learning cycles and limit risk of cost and effort to a smaller time frame. Each Sprint may be considered a short project.

Various practices exist to forecast progress, like burn-downs, burn-ups, or cumulative flows. While proven useful, these do not replace the importance of empiricism. In complex environments, what will happen is unknown. Only what has already happened may be used for forward-looking decision making.

A Sprint could be cancelled if the Sprint Goal becomes obsolete. Only the Product Owner has the authority to cancel the Sprint.

- [ ] True
- [x] False
</details>

### Topic One: Why is this Sprint valuable?
The Product Owner proposes how the product could increase its value and utility in the current Sprint. The whole `Scrum Team` then collaborates to define a `Sprint Goal` that communicates why the Sprint is valuable to stakeholders. The Sprint Goal must be finalized prior to the end of Sprint Planning.

___
#### Question:  
Sprint Planning is not a place for refining Product Backlog items.
(Select the best answer)
- [x] FALSE
- [ ] TRUE
</details>

### Topic Three: How will the chosen work get done?
For each selected Product Backlog item, the Developers plan the work necessary to create an Increment that meets the Definition of Done. This is `often` done by decomposing Product Backlog items into smaller work items of one day or less. How this is done is at the sole discretion of the Developers. No one else tells them how to turn Product Backlog items into Increments of value.

The Sprint Goal, the Product Backlog items selected for the Sprint, plus the plan for delivering them are together referred to as the Sprint Backlog.

Sprint Planning is timeboxed to a maximum of eight hours for a one-month Sprint. For shorter Sprints, the event is usually shorter.

- [ ] Yes, all items in the Sprint Backlog should be decomposed to units of one day or less by the end of the Sprint Planning
</details>

## Daily Scrum
The purpose of the Daily Scrum is to inspect progress toward the Sprint Goal and adapt the Sprint Backlog as necessary, adjusting the upcoming planned work.

The Daily Scrum is a `15-minute` event for the Developers of the Scrum Team. To `reduce complexity`, it is held at the same time and place every working day of the Sprint. If the Product Owner or Scrum Master are actively working on items in the Sprint Backlog, they participate as Developers.

The Developers can select whatever structure and techniques they want, as long as their Daily Scrum focuses on progress toward the Sprint Goal and produces an actionable plan for the next day of work. This creates focus and improves self-management.

Daily Scrums improve communications, identify impediments, promote quick decision-making, and consequently eliminate the need for other meetings.

The Daily Scrum is not the only time Developers are allowed to adjust their plan. They often meet throughout the day for more detailed discussions about adapting or re-planning the rest of the Sprint’s work.

## Sprint Review
The purpose of the Sprint Review is to inspect the outcome of the Sprint and determine future adaptations. The Scrum Team presents the results of their work to `key stakeholders` and progress toward the Product Goal is discussed.

During the event, the Scrum Team and stakeholders review what was accomplished in the Sprint and what has changed in their environment. Based on this information, attendees collaborate on what to do next. The Product Backlog may also be `adjusted` to meet new opportunities. The Sprint Review is a working session and the Scrum Team should avoid limiting it to a presentation.

The Sprint Review is the `second to last event` of the Sprint and is timeboxed to a maximum of `four hours for a one-month Sprint`. For shorter Sprints, the event is usually shorter.

<details><summary>Questions</summary>

#### Question:  
Who attends the Sprint Review?
(choose all that apply)
- [x] The Scrum Master.
- [x] Key Stakeholders
- [x] The Developers
- [x] The Product Owner.
___
#### Question:  
In which Scrum event do key stakeholders collaborate with the Scrum Team about the outcome of the Sprint and future adaptations?
(choose the best answer)
- [ ] The Sprint Planning
- [ ] The Daily Scrum
- [x] The Sprint Review
- [ ] The Sprint Retrospective
___
#### Question:  
What is a possible result of the Sprint Review?
(choose the best answer)
- [ ] A list of improvements that the Scrum Team will implement in the next Sprint
- [ ] A common understanding of what can be delivered in the Increment and how will the work needed to deliver the Increment be achieved
- [ ] A common understanding of progress toward the Sprint Goal and how progress is trending toward completing the work in the Sprint Backlog
- [x] A revised Product Backlog that defines the probable Product Backlog items for the next Sprint.
</details>

## Sprint Retrospective
The purpose of the Sprint Retrospective is to plan ways to increase quality and effectiveness.

The Scrum Team inspects how the last Sprint went with regards to individuals, interactions, processes, tools, and their Definition of Done. Inspected elements often vary with the domain of work. Assumptions that led them astray are identified and their origins explored. The Scrum Team discusses what went well during the Sprint, what problems it encountered, and how those problems were (or were not) solved.

The Scrum Team identifies the most helpful changes to improve its effectiveness. The most impactful improvements are addressed as soon as possible. They may even be added to the Sprint Backlog for the next Sprint.

The Sprint Retrospective concludes the Sprint. It is timeboxed to a maximum of three hours for a one-month Sprint. For shorter Sprints, the event is usually shorter.

# Scrum Artifacts
Scrum’s artifacts `represent work or value`. They are designed to maximize `transparency` of key information. Thus, everyone inspecting them has the same basis for `adaptation`.
Each artifact contains a `commitment` to ensure it provides information that enhances transparency and focus against which progress can be measured:
- For the Product Backlog it is the Product Goal.
- For the Sprint Backlog it is the Sprint Goal.
- For the Increment it is the Definition of Done.

These commitments exist to reinforce empiricism and the Scrum values for the Scrum Team and their stakeholders.

</details>

## Product Backlog
The Product Backlog is an emergent, ordered list of what is needed to improve the product. It is the single source of work undertaken by the Scrum Team.

Product Backlog items that can be Done by the Scrum Team within one Sprint are deemed ready for selection in a Sprint Planning event. They usually acquire this degree of transparency after refining activities. Product Backlog refinement is the act of breaking down and further defining Product Backlog items into smaller more precise items. This is an ongoing activity to add details, such as a description, order, and size. Attributes often vary with the domain of work.

The Developers who will be doing the work are responsible for the sizing. The Product Owner may influence the Developers by helping them understand and select trade-offs.

### Commitment: Product Goal
The Product Goal describes a `future state` of the product which can serve as a target for the Scrum Team to plan against. The Product Goal is in the Product Backlog. The rest of the Product Backlog emerges to define “what” will fulfill the Product Goal.

> A product is a vehicle to deliver value. It has a clear boundary, known stakeholders, well-defined users or customers. A product could be a service, a physical product, or something more abstract.`

The Product Goal is the long-term objective for the Scrum Team. They must fulfill (or abandon) `one objective before taking on the next.`

<details><summary>Questions</summary>

#### Question:  
Which of the following is false about the Product Goal.
(choose the best answer)
- [ ] When reaching the Product Goal, the Scrum Team chooses to release or not the Increment.
- [ ] The Product Owner is also accountable for developing and explicitly communicating the Product Goal.
- [ ] The Scrum Team must fulfill (or abandon) one Product Goal before taking on the next.
- [ ] The Product Goal is in the Product Backlog.
- [x] For the Product Goal to be fulfilled, the entire Product Backlog must be Done.
- [ ] The Product Goal is the long-term objective of the Scrum Team.

Explanation  
The Product Goal describes a future state of the product which can serve as a target for the Scrum Team to plan against. The Product Goal is in the Product Backlog. The rest of the Product Backlog emerges to define “what” will fulfill the Product Goal.
The Product Goal is the long-term objective for the Scrum Team. They must fulfill (or abandon) one objective before taking on the next.
___
#### Question:  
Which of the following are correct regarding the Product Goal?
(choose the best four answers)
- [ ] Once a product reaches the Product Goal, it must be released.
- [ ] In the case of existing multiple Product Goals, they must be organized into a Product Roadmap.
- [ ] The Product Goal must consist of a vision statement, the main features, a deadline, and target measures.
- [x] During the Sprint Review, progress toward the Product Goal is discussed.
- [x] The Scrum Team must only pursue one Product Goal at a time.
- [x] If there are multiple Scrum Teams working on the same product, they should share the same Product Goal.
- [x] An Increment is a concrete stepping stone toward the Product Goal.

Explanation  
The Scrum Guide does not prescribe the use of a Product Roadmap, the components of the Product Goal, neither when to release the product.
</details>

## Sprint Backlog
The Sprint Backlog is composed of the Sprint Goal (why), the set of Product Backlog items selected for the Sprint (what), as well as an actionable plan for delivering the Increment (how).
The Sprint Backlog is a plan by and for the Developers. It is a highly visible, real-time picture of the work that the Developers plan to accomplish during the Sprint in order to achieve the Sprint Goal. Consequently, the Sprint Backlog is updated throughout the Sprint as more is learned. It should have enough detail that they can inspect their progress in the Daily Scrum.

### Commitment: Sprint Goal
The Sprint Goal is the single objective for the Sprint. Although the Sprint Goal is a commitment by the Developers, it provides flexibility in terms of the exact work needed to achieve it. The Sprint Goal also creates coherence and focus, encouraging the Scrum Team to work together rather than on separate initiatives.

The Sprint Goal is created during the Sprint Planning event and then added to the Sprint Backlog. As the Developers work during the Sprint, they keep the Sprint Goal in mind. If the work turns out to be different than they expected, they collaborate with the Product Owner to negotiate the scope of the Sprint Backlog within the Sprint without affecting the Sprint Goal.

## Increment
An Increment is a concrete stepping stone toward the Product Goal. Each Increment is `additive` to all prior Increments and thoroughly verified, ensuring that all Increments work together. In order to provide value, the Increment must be usable.

Multiple Increments may be created within a Sprint. The sum of the Increments is presented at the `Sprint Review` thus supporting empiricism. However, an Increment may be delivered to stakeholders prior to the end of the Sprint. The Sprint Review should never be considered a gate to releasing value.

Work cannot be considered part of an Increment unless it meets the Definition of Done.

<details><summary>Questions</summary>

#### Question:  
The Increment is:
- [ ] All items in the Sprint Backlog that could be released regardless of whether the Product Owner decides to actually do it
- [ ] All "Done" items in the Sprint Backlog
- [x] Additive to all prior Increments and thoroughly verified, ensuring that all Increments work together.
- [ ] The sum of all the Product Backlog items completed during the Sprint
- [ ] The sum of all the Product Backlog items completed during the Sprint, excluding the value of the increments of all previous Sprints.
___
#### Question:  
Choose two alternatives among the statements below that are true about an undone Product Backlog item.
I. Consider the done part of the item in velocity calculation and then create a new item in the Product Backlog for the remaining work.
II. Demonstrate it in the Sprint Review meeting, even if it is not within the terms of acceptance. It is important to get feedback.
III. Move it back to the Product Backlog.
IV. Do not include it in the Increment.
V. It could be added to the Increment if it does not fail in the user acceptance tests.
- [ ] I and II
- [ ] I and V
- [ ] II and III
- [x] III and IV
- [ ] IV and V
</details>

### Commitment: Definition of Done
The Definition of Done is a formal description of the state of the Increment when it `meets the quality measures` required for the product.

The moment a Product Backlog item meets the Definition of Done, an Increment is born.

The Definition of Done creates `transparency` by providing everyone a shared understanding of what work was completed as part of the Increment. If a Product Backlog item does not meet the Definition of Done, it cannot be released or even presented at the Sprint Review. Instead, it returns to the Product Backlog for future consideration.

If the Definition of Done for an increment is part of the `standards of the organization`, all Scrum Teams must follow it as a `minimum`. If it is not an organizational standard, the `Scrum Team` must create a Definition of Done appropriate for the product.

The Developers are required to conform to the Definition of Done. If there are multiple Scrum Teams working together on a product, they must mutually define and comply with the same Definition of Done.

<details><summary>Questions</summary>

#### Question:  
How does the Definition of Done (DoD) help the Scrum Team?
(choose the best three answers)
- [x] DoD is used to assess when work is complete.
- [x] DoD ensures artifact transparency
- [ ] DoD helps to calculate the velocity of the Scrum Team
- [x] DoD guides the Developers in knowing how many Product Backlog items it can select during Sprint Planning.

Explanation  
The Definition of Done is a formal description of the state of the Increment when it meets the quality measures required for the product.  The Definition of Done creates transparency by providing everyone a shared understanding of what work was completed as part of the Increment.
___
#### Question:  
Which of the following are true regarding the Definition of Done?

- [x] Guides the Developers on how many Product Backlog items to select for the Sprint
- [x] Is committed to by the Increment
- [ ] Defines the criteria for a Sprint to be Done
- [x] Increases transparency

Explanation  
a. The Definition of Done is a formal description of the state of the Increment when it meets the quality measures required for the product. B. It is one of the factors used by the Developers during Sprint Planning to define what can be Done during the given Sprint. C. The Increment commits to the Definition of Done. d. It defines when a Product Backlog item becomes an Increment. E. The Definition of Done creates transparency by providing everyone a shared understanding of what work was completed as part of the Increment.
___
#### Question:  
Select the two most suited items that should be taken into the reckoning for the Definition of Done?
(choose the best two answers)
- [ ] Definition of Done of other Scrum Teams working on other products
- [x] The standards of the Organization
- [x] Definition of Done of other Scrum Teams working on the same Product
- [ ] Advice of the Scrum Master
- [ ] Experience of the Product Owner

Explanation  
If the Definition of Done for an increment is part of the standards of the organization, all Scrum Teams must follow it as a minimum. If it is not an organizational standard, the Scrum Team must create a Definition of Done appropriate for the product.
The Developers are required to conform to the Definition of Done. If there are multiple Scrum Teams working together on a product, they must mutually define and comply with the same Definition of Done.
___
#### Question:  
Who is responsible for creating the Definition of Done?
(choose the best answer)
- [ ] The Scrum Master
- [ ] The Developers
- [ ] The Product Owner
- [x] The Scrum Team

Explanation  
If the Definition of Done for an increment is part of the standards of the organization, all Scrum Teams must follow it as a minimum. If it is not an organizational standard, the Scrum Team must create a Definition of Done appropriate for the product.
The Developers are required to conform to the Definition of Done. If there are multiple Scrum Teams working together on a product, they must mutually define and comply with the same Definition of Done.
___
#### Question:  
How does the Definition of “Done” (DoD) help the Scrum Team? Select the three most applicable items.
- [x] DoD is used to assess when work is complete on the product Increment.
- [ ] DoD helps to calculate the velocity of the Scrum Team
- [x] DoD ensures artifact transparency
- [x] DoD guides the Developers in knowing how many Product Backlog items it can select during Sprint Planning.
- [ ] DoD defines when a Product Backlog item may be considered during Sprint Planning
___
#### Question:  
When is an item in the Sprint Backlog considered complete?
- [ ] When the Sprint is over
- [ ] The item has all the quality requirements defined by the Product Owner.
- [ ] When the customer approves its completeness
- [x] When it's usable, fulfilling the Definition of Done and becoming an Increment.

Explanation  
a. Maybe you may not even start working on the item before the Sprint was over, then you can't call it complete.
b. They can still miss something. On the other hand, if the test is focused on the unit, what about testing the integrated solution? It may break something.
c. It doesn't guarantee that we're absolutely done with the item and that it satisfies the customer and user.
A Product Backlog item that you have in the Sprint Backlog is Done when it satisfies the Definition of Done.
Note: usable for end-users = potentially shippable = potentially releasable = Done based on the Definition of Done.
An Increment is a concrete stepping stone toward the Product Goal. Each Increment is additive to all prior Increments and thoroughly verified, ensuring that all Increments work together. In order to provide value, the Increment must be usable.
